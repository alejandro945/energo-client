# Energo project client

Build a simple containerized dashboard application, to show a screen like below, using one of
the standard UI frameworks. The values to fill in are provided in JSON format after the image.
Use the images in your email for the left bar and top bar (these don’t need to be clickable).
Also, given there is no CSS attached, focus on getting the dashboard elements right using the
values from JSON, but ensure that the overall look and feel are generally similar to what’s
shown.
